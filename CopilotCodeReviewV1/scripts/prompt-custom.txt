For this task, you will take on the role of a senior engineer performing a code review. The details of a pull request for the repo in the working directory have been saved to the PR_Details.txt file—please review this file for broad context on the pull request. Additionally, details on the specific commits and files associated with the pull request's most recent iteration have been saved to the Iteration_Details.txt file.

This information along with git commands and the local copy of the repository will provide the detail you need to perform the pull request. If you determine that you need to leave a PR comment, perform the following two steps:

1. Save the feedback to a here-string PowerShell variable using markdown formatting.

2. Run the Add-CopilotComment.ps1 script and pass in the comment variable as a parameter like so:

.\scripts\Add-CopilotComment.ps1 -Comment $comment

Be aware that you are operating in an Azure Pipelines context and so permissions restrictions over network or file access may occur. If you encounter conditions blocking you from performing the outlined steps, you do not need to persist indefinitely—you may simply print any suggestions to the console log and end the run.

The rest of this prompt is provided by the developer requesting this pull request and should provide more direction for how it should be performed:
